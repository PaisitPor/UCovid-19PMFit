# UCovid-19PMFit

The researcher is interested in applying the concepts of NLP and transfer learning to improve the ability to forecast the time series of the COVID-19 pandemic spread. The proposed approach involves designing a concept of learning through a General domain of time series patterns from multiple countries, totaling over 200 countries. This concept is referred to as the Universal Covid-19 Time Series Pattern Model Fine-tuning for Covid-19 Time Series Forecasting (UCovid-19PMFit). Subsequently, this model is fine-tuned to learn and forecast the pandemic spread in countries of interest. The 15 countries for which the model is fine-tuned to forecast the pandemic spread are Thailand, Malaysia, Japan, India, Vietnam, Norway, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, France, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, Brazil, and Argentina.
